# CMS
A Content Management System with users who can login and create and view pages of content built using a light MVC approach.

The CMS can be viewed <a href="http://markonesolutions.com/CMS/index.php">here</a>

There are three login types, public, author and admin the usernames and passwords to login are as follows:

username: public@example.com
password: publicPass

username:author@example.com
password:authorPass

username: admin@example.com
password: adminPass

When logged in as public the user can only view pages. When logged in as author the user can create a new page and can potentially edit pages the author has created. When logged in as admin the user can add new pages and edit (this function not completed yet) any pages.
